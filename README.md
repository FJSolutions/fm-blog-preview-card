## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- PostCSS with the postcss-nesting plugin
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using PostCSS with plugins
- Using the File Watchers feature in webStorm

```css
.author {
  display: flex;
  align-items: anchor-center;
}
```
This property gives better text alignment next to an image than `center`.

### Continued development

The next step would be to create a grid of these components and add a linking mechanism to the actual blog post.
